My first texture will change the vanilla elytra to the Ender Dragon wings in purple to match the color palette of the Enderman and the Ender Dragon (or just because purple is my favorite color lol).\n\n    1) The texture is compatible with Action & Stuff;\n\n    2) This is the first texture I've made, so I apologize if it's very simple or bad."
